/**
 ** Utility class for sending output to two OutputStream objects at
 ** once.
 **
 ** <p>You simply instantiate the class by supplying two streams, then
 ** all output operations are proxied to both streams in sequence. A
 ** given operation is always performed on out1 first, and then on
 ** out2. The operation is performed on out2 regardless of whether or
 ** not out1 caused an IOException to be thrown.
 **
 ** <p>Since a single operation is thus capable of generating two
 ** IOExceptions (in the event that BOTH underlying streams throw
 ** one), all member functions of this class are declared to throw
 ** {@link DualIOException}, which wraps one or two IOExceptions.
 **
 ** <p>Non-IOException exceptions propagate out of all methods on
 ** their own, without being wrapped in a DualIOException. Note that
 ** this means a non-IOException is capable of resulting in failed
 ** parallelism for the two streams.
 **
 ** <p>No added synchronization is provided by this class, beyond
 ** whatever may already be present in the underlying streams.
