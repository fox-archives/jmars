/**
 ** Encapsulates a mechanism for creating new LView objects, and for
 ** internally managing the layers they're linked to. Every factory
 ** must implement, at a minimum, {@link #createLView()}. Factories
 ** requiring user interaction for parameters must implement {@link
 ** #createLView(LViewFactory.Callback)} as well. Finally, most
 ** factories will want to implement {@link #getName} and {@link
 ** #getDesc} to be friendly to the user.
 **
 ** <p>To "add a layer to application", ultimately, requires only a
 ** new LViewFactory be added to {@link #factoryList}. This is the
 ** sole entry point that the application uses to query and create
 ** layers for the user. Typically, an addition to this list will also
 ** involve the subclassing of {@link LViewFactory}, {@link Layer},
 ** and {@link Layer.LView} for the new layer type. Strictly speaking,
 ** however, the application's "perception" of what layers are
 ** available is dictated solely through the <code>factoryList</code>.
 **
 ** <p>Because creation of a new layer/view often requires user
 ** interaction with a dialog, the creation can be done
 ** asynchronously. Clients of LViewFactory can either create a
 ** "default" version of a view (kind of a kludge to facilitate
 ** getting useful data from the start of the application)
 ** synchronously by invoking {@link #createLView()}. Or they can
 ** invoke asynchronous creation with user interaction by using {@link
 ** #createLView(LViewFactory.Callback)}.
 **
 ** <p>The default superclass implementation of the callback
 ** asynchronous version actually just calls the synchronous version,
 ** so simple factories don't have to implement both methods if they
 ** don't want/need to.
 **
 ** <p>Clients of LViewFactory will generally not instantiate
 ** LViewFactory objects directly... instead, the static {@link
 ** #factoryList} member will be used to locate and use a factory
