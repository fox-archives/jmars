/**
 * A set of attributes for a specific feature and a reference to the owning
 * FeatureCollection. The FeatureCollection contains the schema, event
 * listeners, and history logging tools for every Feature.
 * <p>The Feature class contains a map of attributes; for each unique Field,
 * an Object can be stored.
 * <p>This class also contains a back reference to the collection that
 * owns it. Feature instances are contained in exactly one FeatureCollection.
 * This tight coupling between container and contained element greatly
 * simplifies three needs of Feature:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Schema; each Feature in a FeatureCollection is homogeneous, so the
 * schema is stored on the collection instead of on the feature.
 * <li>Events: each change to a Feature is sent to listeners registered on the
 * FeatureCollection. Changes to the collection's Features or the schema are
 * also sent to the listeners.
 * <li>History: Feature instances share a single History instance through the
 * FeatureCollection, ensuring the entire collection and contents are
 * versioned correctly.
 * </ul>
