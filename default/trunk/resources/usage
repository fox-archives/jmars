JMARS command-line argument combinations:

	<longitude> <latitude>
	<Previously saved *.jmars or *.jlf file>
	<longitude> <latitude> <previously saved *.jlf file>

The longitude is degrees east of the prime meridian and the latitude is
geocentric degrees north of the equator.

When the JMARS user interface is running, the File menu has two ways to save
the state for later use:

A .jmars save file may be created with the "Save As" command. It saves all
layers and the position of the view but cannot handle certain types of state.

A .jlf save file may be created with the "Save Layers" command. It saves only
layers, but the user can choose to load saved layers from jlf files while JMARS
is running.

If started with no arguments, longitude and latitude default to zero.

JMARS flags, allowed anywhere on the command-line:

	:
	:<display>
	clean

The single-colon invocation prints a list of available displays. The
colon WITH a display argument specifies a particular alternate display
for multi-head mode. The clean flag forces a fresh start with regard
to the saved layers and the map image cache.

Invoke with "-version" for some useful JMARS version info.
