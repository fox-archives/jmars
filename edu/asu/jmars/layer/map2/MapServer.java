/**
 * MapServer stores properties for a WMS Map Server.
 * 
 * Map servers are serialized by the {@link edu.asu.jmars.util.Config}
 * system. The following properties are saved to jmars.config, with
 * a key of <code>map.map_server.name.prop</code> where <code>name</code>
 * is the 'name' property below, and <code>prop</code> is any of the
 * following properties (except 'name'):
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>name: The unique identifier of this map server
 * <li>title: The human-displayable title of the map server
 * <li>url: The location of the server
 * <li>custom: If true, this is a user-defined server in
 * ~/jmars/jmars.config that can be removed.
 * <li>maxRequests: The number of simultaneous requests this server
 * supports.
 * <li>timeout: The number of milliseconds to wait before considering
 * a connection request to have timed out.
 * </ul>
 * @see edu.asu.jmars.util.Config
 * 
 * The {@link MapSource}s in a map server are immutable, for many reasons,
 * so the {@link #add(MapSource)} method sets properties that must have
 * values specific to that MapServer implementation, but that cannot be
 * determined when the MapSource is first created.
